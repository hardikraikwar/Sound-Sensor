# Sound-Sensor
A simple Arduino project where an LED reacts to real-time sound levels. A sound sensor is connected to pin 2 and an LED to pin 13. When the sound level crosses a certain threshold (around 600 during loud noise), the LED turns on. This project helped me understand basic sensor reading, thresholds, and hardware interaction using Arduino.

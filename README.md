SoundSensor-Reactive-LED

A simple Arduino project where an LED reacts to sound levels in real time.

🔊 Project Overview

This project uses a sound sensor connected to pin 2 and an LED connected to pin 13.
When the sound level crosses a set threshold (around 600 during loud noise or claps), the LED turns on.
It’s a beginner-friendly project that teaches basic input/output on Arduino.
